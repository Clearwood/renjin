# From the hash package...

# S4 objects which inherit from environments seem to be treated super-specially
# throughout the GNU R code base.

# Their environment is stored in a special .xData slot, and all of the builtin
# and internal functions which apply to environments should also be useable with
# these objects, even though they are of type S4 and not environment.
