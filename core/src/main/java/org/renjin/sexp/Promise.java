 * Promises are the mechanism by which R implements lazy "call-by-need"

 *
 * Promises enable delayed evaluation in such a way that an expression
 * provided as an argument is evaluated only once, but only if it is
 * used.
 *
 * In Haskell and other lazy functional languages, a "Promise" would be called
 * a "thunk."
