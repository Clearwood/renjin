# Renjin's implementation of the 'identical' primitive doesn't accept the new
# 'ignore.environment' and 'ignore.srcref' arguments:
identical <- function(x, y, num.eq = TRUE, single.NA = TRUE,
                      attrib.as.set = TRUE, ignore.bytecode = TRUE,
                      ignore.environment = FALSE, ignore.srcref = FALSE)
    .Internal(identical(x,y, num.eq, single.NA, attrib.as.set,
                        ignore.bytecode))
