     * GENERAL COMMENT ON GRAPHICS PARAMETERS:
     * ---------------------------------------
     * Graphical parameters are now passed in a pointer to a 
     * graphics context structure (pGEcontext) rather than individually.
     * Each device action should extract the parameters it needs
     * and ignore the others.  Thought should be given to which
     * parameters are relevant in each case -- the graphics engine
     * does not REQUIRE that each parameter is honoured, but if
     * a parameter is NOT honoured, it might be a good idea to
     * issue a warning when a parameter is not honoured (or at
     * the very least document which parameters are not honoured
     * in the user-level documentation for the device).  [An example
     * of a parameter that may not be honoured by many devices is
     * transparency.]

     * do anything.
     * The only parameter is a device driver structure.
